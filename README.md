## What is SelfLink?

SelfLink is an open-source mobile application built with React Native + Expo that explores how social features, personal growth tools, and AI-assisted guidance can coexist in a single, transparent platform.

The project is currently in an early, experimental stage and focuses on:
- user profiles and social interactions
- structured content (posts, comments, messaging)
- an evolving “AI mentor” concept
- internationalization (multi-language support)
- clean mobile architecture and developer experience

SelfLink is not a finished product. It is an open development effort intended for learning, experimentation, and collaboration around modern mobile app patterns.

## Who is this for?

This repository is mainly for:
- React / React Native developers who want to explore Expo-based mobile apps
- Contributors interested in improving architecture, performance, or documentation
- Developers curious about integrating AI features into mobile apps
- Anyone who enjoys shaping early-stage open-source projects

## Scripts

- `npm run lint` – ESLint with import ordering rules.
- `npm run typecheck` – TypeScript in noEmit mode.
- `npm test` – jest-expo test runner.
- `npm run start` – Boot Expo development server with the Auth + navigation stack.

## Environment Config

- `src/config/env.ts` resolves `API_BASE_URL` from `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` (or `expo.extra.backendUrl`), accepts either `https://api.self-link.com` or `https://api.self-link.com/api/v1`, defaults to `https://api.self-link.com`, and derives REST (`/api/v1`), websocket (`/ws`), and media (`/media/*`) URLs from the same host.
- `src/hooks/useBackendHealth.ts` uses those values to test the Django API’s `/api/health/` endpoint by default.
- Extend `src/services/api/client.ts` to add authenticated requests once login is wired.

## Backend URL configuration

- Defaults to `https://api.self-link.com` when no override is provided.
- Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` for overrides (Expo automatically exposes `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` at runtime).
- Examples:
  - Production: `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.self-link.com/api/v1`
  - Local: `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://<LAN_IP>:8000`
- Cloudflare routing assumption: `/api/v1/*` → API (8000), `/ws` → ASGI (8001), `/media/*` → static media server.
- Dev cache-busting: if Cloudflare caches 404s for media during testing, append `?v=<timestamp>` to a media URL; debug builds also auto-append a `v=` query on `/media/*` to force reloads.
- For EAS, add the env var to your build profile or Project → Environment Variables so iOS/Android builds pick it up.

## Authentication Foundation

- `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` stores the JWT, syncs with `expo-secure-store`, and keeps `apiClient` updated.
- `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` provides easy access to `signIn`, `signOut`, and auth state.
- `src/screens/LoginScreen.tsx` offers a metallic-themed sign-in form that hits `/api/v1/auth/login/`, falling back to a mock token for local dev.
- `src/screens/RegisterScreen.tsx` collects the backend-required payload (email, handle, name, password, optional full name/intention) and reuses the toast/auth flows before routing new users into the app.
- `RootNavigator` now gates access: unauthenticated users see the Auth stack; signed-in users flow through onboarding (if needed) and then land in the tabbed experience (Feed, Messages, Mentor, SoulMatch, Payments, etc.).
- Home’s welcome panel shows the active user and exposes a Sign Out CTA, making it easy to switch accounts during testing.
- `src/services/api/user.ts` handles `/api/v1/users/*` (list/detail/follow/followers) plus the `/api/v1/users/me/` hydration flow used by AuthContext.
- Auth automatically refreshes expired access tokens via `/api/v1/auth/token/refresh/`, and falling back to logout if the refresh token is invalid.
- `src/hooks/useUsersDirectory.ts` provides a reusable controller for searching, paginating, and following users against the `/api/v1/users/*` endpoints.
- `src/hooks/usePaymentsCatalog.ts` hydrates gifts, plans, and subscription data so payments UI can stay reactive and shareable across platforms.
- `src/hooks/useMessages.ts` wraps `/api/v1/messages/`, emits typing signals, and ties into the realtime websocket feed for thread activity (with REST fallback).
- `src/services/api/comments.ts` wraps `/api/v1/comments/` so shared clients (mobile/desktop) can page through comment threads and perform CRUD via the same helper.
- `src/services/api/devices.ts` handles `/api/v1/devices/` CRUD so mobile/web can register or remove push tokens consistently.
- `src/services/api/feed.ts` wraps `/api/v1/feed/home/` and `/api/v1/home/highlights/` so all clients can fetch both the paginated timeline and highlight rail with the same helper.
- `src/services/api/matrix.ts` fetches `/api/v1/matrix/profile/` and posts to `/api/v1/matrix/sync/` so the SoulMatch/Mentor areas can share the same profile contract as the backend evolves.
- `src/services/api/media.ts` offers list + CRUD helpers for `/api/v1/media/` and `/api/v1/media/{id}/`, keeping uploads/metadata updates consistent across clients.
- `src/services/api/mentor.ts` exposes CRUD helpers for `/api/v1/mentor/profile/` so mentor personalization can be managed from mobile or desktop with the same code.
- `src/services/api/mentorSessions.ts` wraps `/api/v1/mentor/chat/` and `/api/v1/mentor/history/` so mentor chat, replies, and history stay in sync across clients.
- Mentor chat UI lives in `src/screens/mentor/MentorChatScreen.tsx`; mentor rich-text rendering sits in
  `src/components/chat/MentorMessageContent.tsx`, and chat visual tokens (bubbles, spacing, typography) are centralized in
  `src/theme/chat.ts`.
- `src/services/api/mentorTasks.ts` centralizes `/api/v1/mentor/tasks/`, `/api/v1/mentor/tasks/{id}/`, and `/api/v1/mentor/tasks/today/` calls so daily task queues use shared code.
- `src/services/api/messages.ts` provides list + CRUD helpers for `/api/v1/messages/` so chats and inbox features rely on a single shared wrapper.
- `src/services/api/moderationAdminReports.ts` lets moderators list and manage `/api/v1/moderation/admin/reports/` entries (full CRUD) from any client.
- `src/services/api/moderationEnforcements.ts` fetches `/api/v1/moderation/enforcements/` (with detail lookups) so clients can display the enforcement history tied to a user or post.
- `src/services/api/moderationReports.ts` covers `/api/v1/moderation/reports/` (list + CRUD) for end-user report flows that escalate into moderation queues.
- `src/services/api/notifications.ts` handles `/api/v1/notifications/`, item CRUD, and `/api/v1/notifications/mark-all-read/` so inbox badges stay in sync.
- `src/services/api/payments.ts` centralizes gift types, subscription plans, and subscriptions (`/api/v1/payments/*`) so payments UI shares one contract.
- `src/services/api/posts.ts` offers full CRUD for `/api/v1/posts/`, like/unlike helpers, and shared search functions for both posts and users.
- `src/services/api/soulmatch.ts` provides the `/api/v1/soulmatch/` fetch and `/api/v1/soulmatch/refresh/` mutation used by the SoulMatch screen.
- `src/services/api/threads.ts` and `src/hooks/useThreads.ts` cover `/api/v1/threads/` (list + create + read/typing/leave) so the inbox can pass thread IDs into the messaging flow and keep state fresh.
- `src/components/MetalToast.tsx` and `src/context/ToastContext.tsx` supply metallic toasts used for graceful login/profile error messaging across the app.

## Screens & Navigation

- `FeedScreen` loads the server timeline, offers pull-to-refresh/infinite scroll, and exposes follow/unfollow + profile deep-links for each author. Empty feeds now show a “Create your first post” CTA and a floating “New Post” button.
- `PostDetailsScreen` fetches a single post plus comments and lets you add new comments inline.
- `SearchProfilesScreen` hits `/search/users/`, renders the results list, and lets you jump to a user profile or toggle follow/unfollow directly from the list.
- `UserProfileScreen` fetches `/users/{id}/`, displays follower counts, allows follow/unfollow with optimistic updates, and provides a “Message” button that calls `POST /threads/direct/` (TODO: confirm path) before navigating to Chat.
- `CreatePostScreen` is a simple form that calls `createPost` and returns to the feed when finished.
- Messaging flows now use stacked navigation: `ThreadsScreen` lists threads, provides quick navigation to Chat, and includes a “View profile” affordance for direct threads; `ChatScreen` loads messages, sends via REST, optionally shows a header “Profile” button (if `otherUserId` is provided), and still handles realtime updates.
- `ProfileScreen`, `MentorHomeScreen`, `NotificationsScreen`, etc., remain as before but now can launch the shared search/profile flows.
- `MainTabsNavigator` nests stack navigators for Feed, Messages, and Profile tabs so the new routes (`PostDetails`, `CreatePost`, `SearchProfiles`, `UserProfile`, `Chat`) are properly registered.

## CI

- GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) installs dependencies, then runs lint, typecheck, and tests on pushes and PRs targeting `main`.
- Jest specs cover both UI and auth flows (`src/__tests__/HomeScreen.test.tsx`, `src/__tests__/AuthContext.test.tsx`).
